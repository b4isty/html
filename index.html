<p>There are many household plants that are poisonous to dogs including begonia, Poinsettia and aloe vera.[57]

 <span class="highlight">Some breeds of dogs are prone to certain genetic ailments such as elbow and hip dysplasia,</span> blindness, deafness, pulmonic stenosis, cleft palate, and trick knees. Two serious medical conditions particularly affecting dogs are pyometra, affecting unspayed females of all types and ages, and gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), which affects the larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions, and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as fleas, ticks, and mites, as well as hookworms, tapeworms, roundworms, and heartworms.</p>

 cats in the genus Panthera and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively
 denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding 250 kg (550 lb) in weight,[5] it is the
 second-largest living cat after the tiger, barring hybrids like the liger.[6][7] Wild lions currently exist in
 sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in and around Gir Forest National
 Park).[8] In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia
 from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the
 most widespread large land mammal after humans: Panthera leo spelaea lived in northern and western Europe and
 Panthera leo atrox lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru.[9]<br> The lion is classified as a
 species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline
 in its African range of 30â€“50% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century.[3] Lion
 populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline
 is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are<b> the greatest causes of concern.
  Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.</p>
